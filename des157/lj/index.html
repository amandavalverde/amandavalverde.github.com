            <p>The image above, which contains three polaroids of my parents during the early years of their relationship, serves to illustrate what life for them was like around the time of their meeting. My mother is Jordanian and came to the United States with her family (including eleven other siblings) when she was twelve years old. Her experience as a child immigrant is one that describes her ablility to find supportive Middle Eastern enclaves in the Bay Area while trying to reach some degree of assimilation into American culture in order to thrive.</p>

            <p>The focus of Michael Gonchar's article entitled <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills"</a> is best encapsulated in this quote:</p>
                <q cite="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">Closely reading any text, whether written or visual, requires that students proceed more slowly and methodically, noticing details, making connections and asking questions. This takes practice. But it certainly helps when students want to read the text.</q>
            <p>Using images to create visual interest, heighten awareness, and improve discernment is tremendously useful in the effort to educate an audience, particularly students who can then draw parallels between images and the text it is nested in. The eighth big idea purported to encourage conversation comes from an educator who uses images to spark dialogues in english in her E.S.L. courses. This also necessitates discovery of new vocabulary in order to fully articulate responses and perspectives on exactly what has transpired in the image.</p>
            <p>One website I was abble to find through <a href="awwwards.com">Awwards</a> that utilized exceptional imagery to introduce examples of design work that is very nuanced and powerful is <a href="https://brunoarizio.com/">Studio--BA</a> (Bruno Azario). The overall design of the site, as well as the complex animation for naviagation, really make a stunning impression that requires us to slow town in order to take everything in.</p>

            <p>Naema Baskanderi's article from <a href="https://uxplanet.org">UX Planet</a> entitled <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</a> illustrates how overlays can be implemented in effective UI design. Unfortunately, overlays are often overutilized, prompting users to instinctively and automatically close them from the onset; Baskanderi likens them to the universally-reviled pop-up windows of internet past.</p>
            <p>Overlays, also referred to as modals or dialog windows, are suggested for grabbing the user’s attention, obtaining user input (e.g., sign up or login), and showing additional information (both in and out of context). The anatomy of an overlay should also be carefully crafted. Elements such as an escape hatch (cancel, close, click outside window, escape key), descriptive title, and button labels with actionable, understandable names should enhance usability with adequate mapping and discernable affordances. Baskanderi encourages designers to place modals toward the upper portion of the page, but cautions against making them larger than 50% of the screen in order to preserve context. The lightbox effect, which I have been interested in using in future projects for the course, is also useful for drawing focus to the overlay and indicating that the user cannot interact with the parent page. Finally, the author urges us to make dialog windows user-initiated to avoid having them dismissed rapidly as an uninvited pop-up.</p>
            <p>Modals are discouraged for use on mobile devices as they can often be too large or too small when translated for smaller screens. There are also some key practices that will make using overlays easier and more intuitive for users with accessibility concerns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The element which triggers the dialog must be keyboard accessible</li>
                <li>Once the focus is moved into the dialog, it should be “trapped” inside it until the dialog is closed.</li>
                <li>Each overlay window must have a keyboard accessible control to close that window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Baskanderi also briefly mentions ARIA, <q cite="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make Web content and Web applications more accessible.</q> For more information you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hqhAIjE_8I">ARIA HTML Tutorial - What is ARIA & Why it's Important to Use!</a> on YouTube.</p>

                <h3>21 January 2021</h3>
                <p>The principles from Salim Ansari's <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> were useful in mitigating a number of frustrations that myriad users, myself included, have encountered with forms. One of the more interesting aspects of the article was Ansari's mention of cognitive psychology in UX design, specifically the concept of cognitive load. Ansari writes of multiple steps:
                <q cite="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Studies shows that providing a clear picture of the number of steps it takes to complete the process significantly increases form completion. From the physiological point of view, if users complete the first step, they are more likely to complete the form. Always provide a clear picture of the number of steps left or the percentage of completion through a progress bar.</q></p>
                <p>However, what piqued my interest most were the best practices for accessibility. In the pursuit of stylized web design I think it is easy to forget that some users rely on screen readers, have visual impairments, have cognitive disabilities, etc. These users may also benefit from varied approaches to feedback and responsiveness that we have not already considered. I think an assignment based on designing for accessibility could be really enlightening for us as burgeoning designers. As someone who has never used a screen reader or other assistive technologies, exposure to these kinds of devices and interventions might help us design with greater empathy. I would have loved to do a design internship in a school or facility where I could interact with people who rely on these resources in order to learn and communicate.</p>
