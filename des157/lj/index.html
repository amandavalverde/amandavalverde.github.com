                <h3>21 January 2021</h3>
                <p>The principles from Salim Ansari's <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> were useful in mitigating a number of frustrations that myriad users, myself included, have encountered with forms. One of the more interesting aspects of the article was Ansari's mention of cognitive psychologoy in UX design, specifically the concept of cognitive load. Ansari writes of multiple steps:
                <q cite="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Study shows that providing a clear picture of the number of steps it takes to complete the process significantly increases form completion. From the physiological point of view, if users complete the first step, they are more likely to complete the form. Always provide a clear picture of the number of steps left or the percentage of completion through a progress bar.</q></p>
                <p>However, what piqued my interest most were the best practices for accessibility. In the pursuit of stylized web design I think it is easy to forget that some users are using screen readers, have visual impairments, have cognitive disabilities, etc. These users may also benefit from varied approaches to feedback and responsiveness that we have not already considered. I think an assignment based on designing for accessibility could be really enlightening for us as designers. As someone who has never used a screen reader, or other assistive technologies, exposure to these kinds of devices and interventions might help us design with greater empathy. I would have loved to do a design internship in a school or facility where I could interact with people who rely on these resources in order to learn and communicate.</p>
