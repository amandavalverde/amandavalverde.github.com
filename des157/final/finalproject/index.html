                <h2>Masoud Haddad</h2>
                <p>Uncle Mike (Masoud Haddad) was adopted by my great grandparents when they faced continued infertility issues after the birth of my grandmother. Masoud was born in Palestine but his parents were killed when he was still an infant. He was the first in our family to leave Jordan for the United States, and eventually settled in Los Angeles, CA. Uncle Mike's move had significant influence on the trajectory of my mother's immediate family. Her brother William came to the U.S. at eighteen and lived in Minnesota for some time before his parents and remaining siblings left Jordan. They initially settled in San Francisco and the school-aged children began learning english at an international school in the city.</p>

                <h2>Ruweidah Haddad & Herbert Valverde, 1984</h2>
                <p>My mother and father met in Auburn in 1981 when my mom was a server at The Edelweiss restaurant. The Edelweiss was family-owned and operated by the Haddads, and every one of my mother's siblings worked there at some point to support the family. The story goes that my mother spilled soda on my father while serving him, and he said, "Just for that I'm going to marry you." I guess my dad was quite the charmer.</p>

                <h2>My Parents Getting Married, 1983</h2>
                <p>My mother, Ruweidah, and father, Herbert, were married in a Catholic church in Auburn in 1983. Her dress and veil were made in New York and made her feel especially elegant that day. While there were few members of my father's Costa Rican side of the family present, he had always felt embraced by my mother's Jordanian family. In an effort to be respectful of their sensibilities, my father would often invite my mother's younger siblings on dates so everyone could have dinner or go out together.</p>
                <p>My father left Costa Rica for the U.S. at the age of sixteen. He had asked his older sister, Mercedes, for some financial assistance to make the move, and she reluctantly agreed. As the youngest of five and the only boy, my father felt somewhat out of place in his family. His father, Gerardo, had died when he was ten years old, and his mother was quite a severe person.</p>

                <h2>Grandfather and Mother at Wedding, 1983</h2>
                <p>My grandfather, Jalal Haddad, was born in Jordan to a Lebanese family. He and my grandmother raised their twelve children in towns and cities with Catholic enclaves such as Irbid and Zarqa. He supported his wife and children as a shop owner and had an incredibly kind and gentle disposition. On my mother's wedding day we see him doing his best to remain composed if not stoic, though those who knew him well could tell he was filled with emotion.</p>
