                    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                        <p>A dynamic photo exploration that reveals the history of my family (namely my parents) that utilizes informative overlays and a horizontal scroll design.</p>
                    <h2>Comparison Project I</h2>
                        <a href="http://www.alsafarproject.org/en">Al Safar Project</a>
                        <p>Al Safar Project is a stunning interactive travelogue with rich content and smooth feedback for users to navigate. According to the project Twitter, "Al Safar association follows the legendary 14th century traveler Ibn Battuta to rediscover the territories, cultures and communities on his marvellous journey." This three-year expedition through thirty-eight countries follows the path of medieval explorer Ibn Battuta; while it has been suspended due to travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, there is an abundance of both video and photographic content displayed for each country through scroll-based animations and transitions. There are also a number of typographic elements tied to those transitions that allow the user to remain fully cognizant of their location on the page. My one major critique for the website is the use of a typeface that is in a handwritten style that is occasionally difficult to read, especially when layered over images.</p>
                    <h2>Comparison Project II</h2>
                        <a href="https://culture.basicagency.com/">BASIC&#174; Culture Manual</a>
                        <p>BASIC&#174; is a branding and experience design agency that creates digital platforms and brand programs for companies. What was especially innovative about the design of this page was the animated overlay menu with links that would make the site appear to shift on a horizontal axis. While this is not a side-scrolling design, it offers an interesting approach to moving through sections of information or individual pages of content. While I appreciate a bold achromatic design, some color would be useful in establishing navigation and helping the user make stronger associations with headings or calls to action. Some of the major drawbacks to this complex design are the associated delays as you are trying to scroll; some pages are distractingly choppy and simple animations appear fragmented instead of cohesive.</p>
                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                        <p>My project is ultimately more personal in nature than a travelogue or a design agency website. While I hope to integrate similar JavaScript methods from each of my comparison websites, I definitely want my own project to have a minimalistic feel with harmonious transitions. The Al Safar Project has a complex interface that I aspire to be able to create someday for a brand or organization that requires such a degree of detail (Al Safar includes interactive maps, type in motion, vido overlays, etc). BASIC&#174; Culture Manual has a more streamlined interface, but my own project will not require the animated overlay menu that the Awwwards website highlighted. My aim is to create visual interest with my interface and photographs that draw the use into a narrative about love, culture, and immigration.</p>
                    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
                        <p>Photographs will be "scattered" against a powder blue velvet background as if the user is sorting through photos on a bedspread. The textural quality of the fabric and implied intimacy of a space designated for quiet and contemplation is meant to feel more immersive as users view images and engage the descriptions. The project will include both serif and sans serif typefaces for headers and copy respectively. I would like to implement a horizontal scroll to connote a sense of time and visual narrative moving from left to right. I have abandoned the idea of usine duotone for my images as the coloration of older photos will impart a stronger sense of the decade they were taken in (though aspect ratios, instant film, and digital versus analog will be telling as well).</p>
                    <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                        <p>Most of my interaction strategies will rely on animated transitions such as fading in/out, timing, cursors, and scrolling that will modify my background image. While I think forms and aural feedback have their place in some designs, I don't think they will add anything significant to this project. Audio in general has always felt like a risky endeavor that may turn off users (I personally dislike aural feedback or music that initiates without warning and is not easy to turn off). My project is inherently very visual, so I want to lean into making those visual elements that are part of my interface as strong and intuitive as possible for my audience. Time permitting, I would like to use hotspots for some images that would either trigger the overlays I described earlier or a zoom animation for greater detail.</p>
                    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
                        <p>My hope is that the audience will come away from the project with a newfound or strengthened appreciation for the immigrant experience, as well as some insight into my experience as a second generation American navigating two cultures. For those who have not had similar experiences, I think it is important to establish that different groups have subjective experiences as part of their assimilation, but also face common challenges such as language acquisition, gaining employment, earning citizenship, supporting families overseas, etc. I love the idea that my own family's story could help users achieve greater empathy or pique their interest in multiculturalism within the United States.</p>
