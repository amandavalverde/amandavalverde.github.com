                <h2>Masoud Haddad</h2>
                <p>Uncle Mike (Masoud Haddad) was adopted by my great grandparents when they faced continued infertility issues after the birth of my grandmother. Masoud was born in Palestine but his parents were killed when he was still an infant. He was the first in our family to leave Jordan for the United States, and eventually settled in Los Angeles, CA.</p>

                <h2>Ruweidah Haddad & Herbert Valverde, 1984</h2>
                <p>My mother and father met in Auburn in 1981 when my mom was a server at The Edelweiss restaurant. The Edelweiss was family-owned and operated by the Haddads, and every one of my mother's siblings worked there at some point to support the family. The story goes that my mother spilled soda on my father while serving him, and he said, "Just for that I'm going to marry you." I guess my dad was quite the charmer.</p>

                <p>My mother and father were married in a Catholic church in Auburn in 1983. Her dress and veil were made in New York and made her feel especially elegant that day.</p>
